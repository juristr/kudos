Kudo (for Firebase)[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/juristr/firebase-kudos.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/juristr/firebase-kudos) [![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/)
---

This project started as a small, snowy afternoon project with the aim to experiment a little with Jasmine, Firebase, Grunt and Travis-CI integration.

The idea is to give people Kudo support on their own blogs (like [my](http://juristr.com) [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) one) by using a Firebase backend and this script here.

As far as I know, the concept of "Kudos" originally appeared on [Svbtle blogs](https://svbtle.com/).

## Installation

_(will be added soon)_

## Credits

Credits have to be given to [Amit Upadhyay](http://amitu.com/2013/04/kudos-using-parse-for-jekyll/) who provided the original Kudo implementation by using [Parse](https://parse.com/) as the backend service.
