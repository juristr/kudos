Kudo for Jekyll (but not only)[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/juristr/kudos-jekyll.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/juristr/kudos-jekyll)
---

This project started as a small, snowy afternoon project with the aim to experiment a little with Jasmine, Firebase, Grunt and Travis-CI integration.

The idea is to give people with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) blogs Kudo support which originally (as far as I know) has been introduced on the [Svbtle blog](https://svbtle.com/) engine.

## Installation

_(will be added soon)_

## Credits

Credits have to be given to [Amit Upadhyay](http://amitu.com/2013/04/kudos-using-parse-for-jekyll/) who provided the original Svbtle independent Kudo implementation by using [Parse](https://parse.com/) as the backend service.
